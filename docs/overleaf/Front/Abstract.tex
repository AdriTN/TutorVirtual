This Bachelor’s Thesis presents the design and implementation of a
\emph{personal virtual tutor} that leverages artificial intelligence to deliver
individualised learning across multiple subjects.  
An administrator dashboard lets faculty configure courses, modules, and
syllabi, while the system dynamically adapts exercise difficulty to each
student’s declared skill level.  
The platform features an intuitive web interface and progress dashboards that
offer clear traceability of the learner’s advancement.

The backend relies on Python FastAPI micro-services; a
Retrieval Augmented Generation pipeline combines a vector database with a large
language model served via Ollama to craft context-aware feedback. Metrics are
persisted in PostgreSQL, and the service exposes a JWT-secured REST API.
